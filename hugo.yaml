      # I'm a student interested in self-hosting and homelab stuff!

      > - This blog is mainly used for my own documentation/deployment of difficult or undocumented projects that i find interesting, as well as random things that i might find interesting and worthwhile to write about.


      # My main interests:

      > - Linux.
      > - Anything computer related.
      > - Switching from [Proprietary/Closed Source](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html) software to FLOSS/Open Source alternatives.
      > - Replacing major online services with my own ones (self-hosting), instead of relying on them to work with my [personal data](https://spreadprivacy.com/what-does-google-know-about-me/).


      To be clear: I'm not all against closed source; I pretty much use many of them, and it is impossible to elimiate all of them from my everyday's life. However, I do believe that we should protect our personal data and privacy and limit what multi-billion dollars companies know about us. It's much better to have controls over what you do from self-hosting: You're responsible for your data.
